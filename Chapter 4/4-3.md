# Question
Take a list of 2n real numbers as input. Design an O(n log n) algorithm that partitions the numbers into n pairs, with the property that the partition minimizes the maximum sum of a pair. For example, say we are given the numbers (1,3,5,9). The possible partitions are ((1,3),(5,9)), ((1,5),(3,9)), and ((1,9),(3,5)). The pair sums for these partitions are (4,14), (6,12), and (10,8). Thus, the third partition has 10 as its maximum sum, which is the minimum
over the three partitions.

# Answer
The pair that minimizes the maximum sum of a pair comes out naturally if the 2n numbers are arranged in sorted order. Assuming index starts at 1, we have

1. Sort the 2n numbers -- O(n log n)

2. Iterate through the list and pair the numbers in the form Lᵢ,Lₙ₋ᵢ -- O(n)

## Complexity - O(n log n) + O(n) -- O(n log n)

# Explicitly

```
Partition(L, n):
    L = Sort(L)
    pairs = []
    for i between 0 and L.length:
        pair = {x: 0, y:0}
        pair.x = L[i]
        pair.y = L[n - i]
        pairs.append(pair)
    return pairs

```
