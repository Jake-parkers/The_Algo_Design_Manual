# Question
For each of the following problems, give an algorithm that finds the desired numbers within the given amount of time. Let S be an unsorted array of n integers. Give an algorithm that finds the pair x, y ∈ S that maximizes |x−y|. Your algorithm must run in O(n) worst-case time.

# Answer
Notice that the pair x,y that maximizes |x - y| is going to be the difference between the largest value and the smallest value. Hence since the array is not sorted, we have to look for the min and max. 

## Algorithm

1. Iterate over the unsorted array and pick out the min and the max. -- O(n)

2. Return the pair -- O(1)

## Complexity - O(n) + O(1) -- O(n)
