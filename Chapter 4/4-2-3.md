# Question
For each of the following problems, give an algorithm that finds the desired numbers within the given amount of time. Let S be an unsorted array of n integers. Give an algorithm that finds the pair x, y ∈ S that minimizes |x − y|, for x <> y. Your algorithm must run in O(n log n) worst-case time.

# Answer
Notice that the pair x,y that minimizes |x - y| will definitley sit next to each other in sorted order. Hence to find such a pair in an unsorted array, we do the following

1. Sort array S - O(n log n)

2. Iterate through the sorted array and get the absolute difference between Sᵢ and Sᵢ₊₁. Whichever Sᵢ,Sᵢ₊₁ pair that has the smallest difference is the correct pair. - O(n)

## Complexity - O(n log n) + O(n) -- O(n log n)

## Explicitly

```
MinimumPair(S):
    S = Sort(S)
    min = INF
    pair = {x: 0, y: 0}
    for i bewtween 0 and S.length:
        diff = Abs(S[i] - S[i+1])
        if diff < min:
            min = diff
            pair.x = S[i]
            pair.y = S[i + 1]

    return pair
