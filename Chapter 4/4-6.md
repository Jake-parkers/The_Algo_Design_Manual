# Question

Given two sets S1 and S2 (each of size n), and a number x, describe an O(n log n) algorithm for finding whether there exists a pair of elements, one from S1 and one from S2, that add up to x. (For partial credit, give a Θ(n²) algorithm for this problem.)

# Answer

1. Sort one of the lists say S1 -- O(n log n)

2. Iterate through S2 and replace S2ᵢ with the result of |S2ᵢ - x| -- O(n)

3. For every number in S2 use binary search to find if S2ᵢ is in S1. If any S2ᵢ exists, return, else no numbers in S2 and S1 can add up to x -- O(n log n)

## Complexity - O(n log n) + O(n) + O(n log n) -- O(n log n)

## Explicitly

```
AddUp(S1, S2):
    S1 = sort(S1)

    for i in S2:
        S2[i] = Abs(S2[i] - x)
    
    for number in S2:
        index = BinarySearch(S1, number)
        if index is not null
            return (S1[index], x - number)
        else continue
```
