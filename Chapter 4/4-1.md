# Question

The Grinch is given the job of partitioning 2n players into two teams of n players each. Each player has a numerical rating that measures how good he or she is at the game. The Grinch seeks to divide the players as unfairly as possible, so as to create the biggest possible talent imbalance between the teams. Show how the Grinch can do the job in O(n log n) time.

# Answer

To partition the players as unequally as possible we do the following
1. Sort the `2n` players based on their numerical rating - O(n log n)
2. Divide the sorted list into two `n` halves - O(n)
