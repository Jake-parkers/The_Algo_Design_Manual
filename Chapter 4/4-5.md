# Question

The mode of a bag of numbers is the number that occurs most frequently in the set. The set {4, 6, 2, 4, 3, 1} has a mode of 4. Give an efficient and correct algorithm to compute the mode of a bag of n numbers.

# Answer

## Method 1 -- O(n log n) worst case complexity

1. Sort the numbers in the set -- O(n log n)

2. Iterate through the sorted set and get the longest contigous number sequence -- O(n)

## Complexity - O(n log n) + O(n) -- O(n log n)

## Method 2 -- O(n) expected time

1. Create a hash table with the numbers from the set. Each number serves as the key and the total occurence of each number will be the value. (i.e for each collision we get, the bump up the number in the corresponding column hash table by 1) -- O(n)

2. Find the number in the set that holds the maximum value in the hash table -- O(n)

## Complexity - O(n) + O(n) -- O(n)
