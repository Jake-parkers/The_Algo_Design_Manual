# Question
For each of the following problems, give an algorithm that finds the desired numbers within the given amount of time. Let S be an sorted array of n integers. Give an algorithm that finds the pair x, y ∈ S that maximizes |x−y|. Your algorithm must run in O(1) worst-case time.

# Answer
Notice that the pair x,y that maximizes |x - y| is going to be the difference between the largest value and the smallest value. Hence since the array is sorted, the min and max will be at the first position and last postion of the array respectively

## Algorithm

1. Pick the smallest element from the array (A[0]) -- O(1)

2. Pick the largest element from the array (A[len(A) - 1]) -- O(1)

2. Return the pair (largest, smallest) -- O(1)

## Complexity - O(1)
