# Question 

Assume that we are given n pairs of items as input, where the first item is a number and the second item is one of three colors (red, blue, or yellow). Further assume that the items are sorted by number. Give an O(n) algorithm to sort the items by color (all reds before all blues before all yellows) such that the numbers for identical colors stay sorted. For example: (1,blue), (3,red), (4,blue), (6,yellow), (9,red) should become (3,red),
(9,red), (1,blue), (4,blue), (6,yellow).

# Answer
For this problem, applying the bucket sort strategy is the way to go. However, rather than randomly scattering (usually with a formula) the pairs of items into different buckets, we will carefully put items that have the same color in the same bucket and then proceed from there.

1. Iterate over the pairs of items and place items with the same color in the same bucket. (the placement of the items in the bucket should respect the order - all reds before all blues before all yellows) -- O(n)

2. Replace the pairs in the original array with the pairs from each bucket (starting from the top or beginning) - O(k) -- where k is the bucket size 

3. In a single pass through the modified original array, ensure that pairs with the same color sitting besides each other are not out of order (i.e the pair with the smaller number must come before the pair with the larger number if they both have the same color) -- O(k + n) since n >= k, O(n)

## Complexity - O(n) + O(k) + O(n) -- O(n)

## Explicitly
```
SortByColor(pairsList, bsize):
    // n is bucket size
    bucket = Array[bsize]
    Colors {
        red: 0,
        yellow: 1,
        green: 2
    }

    // Step 1 from above
    for i in pairsList:
        index = Colors[pairsList[i].color]
        if bucket[index] is null:
            bucket[index] = []
        bucket[index].append((pairsList[i].num, pairsList[i].color))
    
    // Step 2 from above
    count = 0
    for index in bucket:
        for pair in bucket[index]:
            pairsList[count++] = pair

    // Step 3 from above
    for i in pairsList:
        if pairsList[i].num > pairsList[i + 1].num
            swap(pairsList[i], pairsList[i + 1])
    
    return pairsList
